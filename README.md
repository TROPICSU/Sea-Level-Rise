# Sea-Level-Rise
Aim : Analyze sea level data from around the world which has been calculated using method of back propagation to the year 1880. The data has been calculated using a method of back propagation to the year 1880 with the help of the recorded data from 1993-2013.
 
We have two code files iin this repository with 2 different functions. 
1. Final sea level rise code- Here we have used polynomial regression using degree 2,3 and 4 to predict future values upto 15 years.
2. Normalizing data for tableau code- In this file, we have normalized all columns between 0-1 to t hen plot worldwise sea level rise data for 1 meter and 5 meters.
